# AirBnB_clone
This is a team project to develop a Python3 console that emulates the AirBnb object management.

The console is a command interpreter to manage objects abstraction between objects and how they are stored.

To see the fundamental background of the project visit the Wiki.

The console will perform the following tasks:

* create a new object
* retrieve an object from a file
* perform operations on objects
* destroy any object.

## Storage
All the classes are handled by the `Storage` engine in the `FileStorage` Class.
